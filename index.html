            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <h3>BumbleFormula AI</h3>
            <p>
                BumbleFormula AI is an innovative AI system that predicts user behavior on dating apps based on publicly available data. The model classifies users into distinct categories, providing insights based on feature extraction and classification. Check out the project <a href="https://github.com/Brainydaps/bumble-formula">here</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>AI QR Code Decoder</h3>
            <p>
                This project uses deep learning to decode QR codes into their respective numerical values. The model was trained using AutoKeras on a custom dataset of 2,500 QR codes, each representing a unique four-digit number. You can explore the project <a href="https://github.com/Brainydaps/qr-code-decoder">here</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>AI Calculator</h3>
            <p>
                An advanced calculator that uses machine learning for arithmetic operations. LightGBM handles multiplication and division, while SDCA is used for addition and subtraction. See the project <a href="https://github.com/Brainydaps/ai-calculator">here</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>Talking Stage</h3>
            <p>
                An intelligent chatbot application that predicts user intent and provides relevant responses. This project includes a comprehensive data pipeline and uses LightGBM for improved predictions. View the project <a href="https://github.com/Brainydaps/talking-stage">here</a>.
